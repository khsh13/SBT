# Working
"Not Equal To" is an innovative online platform that allows users to capture pictures of their code and have it scanned and run by machine learning algorithms. 
This is an incredibly useful tool for preparing for interview rounds, where you might be required to write code on a whiteboard or on paper. 

# Why Us?
With "Not Equal To", you can simply snap a photo of your code and see it run in real time, saving you the hassle of having to manually transcribe it onto another surface. Whether you're a beginner looking to improve your coding skills or an experienced developer seeking a new way to practice and test your code, "Not Equal To" is the perfect solution. Give it a try today and see how it can help you ace your next interview

# TechStacks Employed
TailwindCSS, JavaScript, Django, OCN, React.JS, TesseractOCR, Concordium.

# Challenges we faced
Integrating a frontend and backend was a challenging task, especially in the context of a hackathon where time is limited. Some of the challenges during this process included:

-Data formatting: Ensuring that the data being sent between the frontend and backend is properly formatted and can be easily parsed by the receiving system.

-API design: Designing and implementing a clear and consistent API for the frontend and backend to communicate through can be a time-consuming task.

-Security: Ensuring that the frontend and backend are secure and that sensitive data is properly protected is crucial, but we are proud that we acomplished this task in a short time frame.

Using a Concordium extension and implementing OCR (Optical Character Recognition) can add additional layers of complexity to the integration process. For example, ensuring that the Concordium extension is properly configured and that OCR is implemented in a way that is accurate and efficient was challenging.
